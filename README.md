# TidyTuesday EDA

The RForDataScience community maintains [Tidy
Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a repository
providing datasets for practicing data wrangling and analysis.  I don't usually
study these datasets in great detail, but I'll try to post here whenever I get
far enough to produce at least a handful of interesting plots.
